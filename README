Intro
=====

This library provides some useful functions and datastructures for C.
The recommended way to use this project is to copy the relevant files
into your source repository.


Compiling
=========
To build the project and run the tests from the source repository, run

    autoreconf --install
    ./configure
    make
    make check


Modules
=======

The library consists of the following modules, which are mostly independent,
except that some of them depend on Xalloc:


Coreutil (coreutil.h)
---------------------
Macros: MAX, MIN, container_of.

Public Domain.


Hash (hash.h)
-------------

Some simple hash functions, taken from Daniel James' implementaiton in the
boost library.

Boost-1.0 Licence.


Hashset (hashset.{c,h})
-----------------------

This is a partial port of the Google sparsehash library to C.
The project only implements a "hashset", not a "hashmap",
but the functionality is equivalent.  In many cases the names of the functions
are based on the names for the equivalent C# HashSet<T> functions.  The
implementation for "hashset" is based on the implementation of Google's
dense_hashset, while the implementation of "shashset" is based on
Google's sparse_hashset.  See tests/benchmark-hashset.c and
tests/test-hashset.c for sample usage.

Performance for our hashset is comparable to the performance of Google's
dense_hashmap, at least on some simple benchmarks.  Notably, our
"fetch", and "remove" are slightly faster, while our "insert" and "replace"
are slightly slower.

PQueue (pqueue.{c,h})
---------------------
Functions for maintaining an array as a priority queue (heap).

Public Domain.


Timsort (timsort-impl.h, timsort.{c,h})
---------------------------------------

This is a port of the Java/Andorw implementation of Timsort, which itself
is a port of Tim Peter's list sort for Python.

Apache-2.0 Licence


XAlloc (xalloc.{c,h}, xalloc-die.c)
-----------------------------------
Allocation routines that abort on failure.
