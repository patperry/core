This is a partial port of the Google sparsehash library to C, by
Patrick O.  Perry.  The project only implements a "hashset", not a "hashmap",
but the functionality is equivalent.  In many cases the names of the functions
are based on the names for the equivalent C# HashSet<T> functions.  The
implementation for "hashset" is based on the implementation of Google's
dense_hashset, while the implementation of "shashset" is based on
Google's sparse_hashset.  See tests/benchmark.c and tests/test-hashset.c for
sample usage.

Performance for our hashset is comparable to the performance of Google's
dense_hashmap, at least on some simple benchmarks.  Notably, our
"fetch", and "remove" are slightly faster, while our "insert" and "replace"
are slightly slower.

The implementation of "shashset" is currently incomplete.

To build the project and run the tests from the source repository, run

    autoreconf --install
    ./configure
    make
    make check

The recommended way to use this file in your project is to copy the following
files into your project: hashset.{c,h}, xalloc.{c,h}, and xalloc-die.c.  The
"xalloc" files can easily be replaced by your own versions of these files.
